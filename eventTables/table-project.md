# Event Tables

## Create a small single page app to view tables of events.

### Phase 1: HTML/CSS/JSS
- Use the attached mock as a guide to layout the sections of your app.
- Style the elements as you see fit.
- Make sure that the events list and the table scroll independently without losing sight of
the header and tabs.
- Add ability to open tabs by clicking on the Event Types list on the left.

  #### Notes:
    - No need to make the design responsive.
    - No need to worry about browser compatibility. If it works in the latest Chrome
  use it!
    - Feel free to use any preprocessors for your CSS, like Sass
    - Do not use any css frameworks like Bootstrap
  
  #### Bonus Points:
    - Build the project using vanilla javascript.   
    - Display a closing ‘x’ on tabs when a user hovers on them.
    - Ensure that the tabs collapse nicely to display a large number of open tabs (like
  the way Google Chrome tabs behave).
  
  #### Budget:
    - 3-4 hours


### Phase 2: Populate Data
- Populate the Events Type list with data from a server
- Fetch data to display for each open tab

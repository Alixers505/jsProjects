# Front End Masters
[p]: #project

- Directory to hold exercises from courses on Front End Masters

## JavaScript: The Hard Parts -- Will Sentance

- CEO of Codesmith
- Great teacher
- Energizing course
- Teaches with student interaction and examples
- Best done with a partner as he runs the exercises using pair programming methods (but I didn't have one)
- Challenges are available online

## Deep JavaScript Foundations -- Kyle Simpson

Note: skipping this course for now to focus on code, rather than the deep hows and whys

- Author of the "You Don't Know JavaScript" book series
- Teaches by lecture and examples
- Note: this lecture series changed from v2 to v3 while I was in the middle of it, so there is a separate folder (v2) for the exercises I completed in v2, and the v3 files are in directories named for the course section
- The exercises are only available in a downloadable zip

- v2:
    - Not including scope/hoisting exercises, as they seem to be more about refactoring code to meet his best practices than to actually write JS.
    - Including exercises have 1 js file with the original code provided by Kyle Simpson, and a script.js which includes his original code and my edits to meet the challenge
    - The provided HTML and CSS files are included at the root directly, rather than the individual exercise folders

## Complete Intro to React v4 -- Brian Holt

- Sr. Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft
- Nice class structure
- Learn by building an application

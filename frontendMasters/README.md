# Front End Masters
[p]: #project

- Directory to hold exercises from courses on Front End Masters

## JavaScript: The Hard Parts -- Will Sentance

- CEO of Codesmith
- Great teacher
- Energizing course
- Teaches with student interaction and examples
- Best done with a partner as he runs the exercises using pair programming methods (but I didn't have one)
- Challenges are available online

## Deep JavaScript Foundations -- Kyle Simpson

- Author of the "You Don't Know JavaScript" book series
- Teaches by lecture and examples
- Challenges include pop-quizzes and exercises, the exercises are only available in a downloadable zip

  - Not including scope/hoisting exercises, as they seem to be more about refactoring code to meet his best practices than to actually write JS.
  - Including exercises have 1 js file with the original code provided by Kyle Simpson, and a script.js which includes his original code and my edits to meet the challenge
  - The provided HTML and CSS files are included at the root directly, rather than the individual exercise folders
